## VroumBot presentation

This repo is a test to hosts our slides for the final presentation of our project. 

It is still in *very* early development.

You can find [examples](examples) and a [demo file](demo.html). (to be deleted) These examples come from [reveal.js](https://revealjs.com), the founder of the framework used.

We can use slides.com to edit the slides and then export them to html.
